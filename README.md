# 1. Compulsory algorithm Assignment - Experiments and Sorting.
short description

## Birthday Experiencement
Birthday problem. Write a program that takes an integer N from the command
line and uses StdRandom.uniform() to generate a random sequence of integers between
0 and N – 1. Run experiments to validate the hypothesis that the number of
integers generated before the first repeated value is found is ~√(pi)N/2.

## Coupon collector problem.
Coupon collector problem. Generating random integers as in the previous exercise,
run experiments to validate the hypothesis that the number of integers generated
before all possible values are generated is ~N HN.

## Deck sort
Explain how you would put a deck of cards in order by suit (in the
order spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds) and by rank within each suit, with the restriction
that the cards must be laid out face down in a row, and the only allowed operations are
to check the values of two cards and to exchange two cards (keeping them face down).
